This Repository have some examples of interactive BackGrounds for websites, I have tried these by learning to do so from the internet. The contents include-
    Collision Interaction
    Flow Fields
    Mouse Bubbles
    PNG slide through
    Sine Wave Effect(Working on this)

You can use these to take more ideas, for your projects. Also I would be helped if you can suggest some updates I can do to make these code shorter or an alternate way to do the same.

I'll be waiting for suggestions.

Thank you
PKS.
